# Deep Learning project for automatic defect detection of Manufactured Solar Cells

Project Description:
>  There was dynamic development of various Deep Learning applications in the recent years. One of those is inspection of manufactured goods in search for defects and therefore defected products. This application is rather broad, as designing appropriate solutions one can encounter various challenges and therefore different approaches can be the most optimal in different cases. The description of Photovoltaic Cells inspection case and discussion on possible solutions with itâ€™s advantages and disadvantages is covered in the next chapters.
>
> The purpose of this study is therefore to identify challenges that are present in the chosen case, discuss possible solutions and choose most promising ones and thereafter make an implementation of this solution/s in this real world scenario.
>
> What is intended in this practice is to find a method through Deep Learning that facilitates the inspection of solar cells in their production process. For this, photographs of different cells will be analysed, they will be classified as "good" or "bad" depending on whether they have defects or not, and the defects of the bad cells and their magnitude will be identified.As for the Deep Learning model to be used, there will be a database with photographs of "good" and "bad" cells that will be used to carry out the training.
